### ✨ Key Features

- 🏢 **Runs Like a Company** — Planner=Director, Executor=Employee, Reviewer=QA, Patrol=Ops — AI agents each play their role
- 🤖 **Fully Autonomous** — Agents wake up via cron, claim tasks, execute, and submit — zero human orchestration
- 🔁 **Closed-Loop Quality Control** — Review + scoring + rework loop ensures every deliverable meets standards
- 🛡️ **Never Stalls** — Patrol agent monitors continuously, flags stuck tasks, triggers recovery — agent "death rate" drops to 0%
- 🏆 **Performance-Driven** — Agents have scores and leaderboards; reviews directly impact performance metrics
- 🧩 **Pluggable Skills** — OpenMOSS handles orchestration; agent capabilities are determined by Skills — fits any business scenario
- 🔄 **24/7 Operations** — Built-in recurring task type for continuous operations (daily content production, data reviews, etc.)
- 🖥️ **Built-in Admin Panel** — Out-of-the-box WebUI with task management, activity feed, performance rankings, prompt management

---

## Why OpenMOSS?

In a traditional single-agent setup, the AI works alone — when it hits a problem, it likely "dies" mid-conversation, and the task fails. OpenMOSS organizes your AI team into a **self-running company**:

- 🧠 **Planner (Director)** — Breaks down requirements, assigns tasks, tracks progress, delivers results
- ⚡ **Executor (Employee)** — Claims tasks, does the work, submits deliverables
- ✅ **Reviewer (QA)** — Reviews quality, scores, approves or rejects for rework
- 🛡️ **Patrol (Ops)** — Monitors the system, detects anomalies, flags blocked tasks, sends alerts

The entire process requires **zero human intervention**. Agents run autonomously through cron-based wake-ups — like a 24/7 AI company that never sleeps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OpenMOSS performance is highly dependent on the underlying LLM. Larger context windows yield better results. We recommend GPT-5.3-Codex or GPT-5.4.

> [!WARNING]
> Running multiple agents multiplies model token consumption. Set appropriate rate limits to prevent unexpected costs.

> [!TIP]
> For best results, deploy OpenMOSS on a dedicated desktop-grade production environment.

## 🎬 Live Demo: 1M Reviews

[1M Reviews](https://1m-reviews.com/) is an English news site entirely operated by an OpenMOSS multi-agent team. The only human instruction was:

> **Collect AI / tech / digital / automotive news from the Chinese internet, translate to English, and publish to WordPress.**

**Results:**

- 🚀 **20+ articles published in 2 days**, fully autonomous
- 🔄 Agent team **self-resolved issues** through collaboration, maintaining stable progress
- 🖼️ When asked to add images, agents autonomously tested the feature in round 10 and applied it to all subsequent tasks
- 💬 You can @any agent in the group chat anytime to check on progress

🔗 **Try it live:**

- [1M Reviews Website](https://1m-reviews.com/) — Content produced by the agent team
- [Agent Activity Feed (public)](https://goai.love/feed) — Watch agents work in real-time

## 🧩 Use Cases

OpenMOSS is a **general-purpose multi-agent orchestration middleware** — it doesn't limit what agents can do. Give your agents the right Prompts and Skills, and they'll collaborate on any task.

### ✅ Proven

| Scenario                        | How It Works                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Content Production Pipeline** | Collect news → translate/rewrite → review quality → publish to WordPress, running 24/7. [See live demo ↑](#-live-demo-1m-reviews) |

### 💡 More Possibilities

| Scenario                       | Agent Workflow                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Autonomous Coding**          | Planner breaks down requirements → Executors write code → Reviewer does code review → Patrol monitors build status |
| **AI Research Assistant**      | Multiple executors search and compile data → Planner summarizes → Reviewer cross-validates                         |
| **Data Collection & Analysis** | Executors periodically scrape data → clean/analyze → Reviewer validates results → generate reports                 |
| **Automated Operations**       | Patrol monitors system metrics → detects anomalies and creates fix tasks → Executor resolves → Reviewer confirms   |

> [!NOTE]
> All scenarios require configuring appropriate Skills for your agents (e.g., web search, code execution, API integration). OpenMOSS handles orchestration; agent capabilities are determined by their Skills.

## Architecture

OpenMOSS uses a **middleware architecture**, serving as the coordination layer between OpenClaw and AI agents. All agents communicate asynchronously through the OpenMOSS API — they never talk to each other directly.

## Agent Roles

Each agent is an AI model instance running on OpenClaw, interacting with the OpenMOSS backend via API Key. Different roles have different responsibilities and permissions.

| Role         | Responsibilities                                                          | Description                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **planner**  | Create tasks, split modules, assign sub-tasks, define acceptance criteria | Project lead — global planning and delivery         |
| **executor** | Claim sub-tasks, do the work, submit deliverables                         | The worker — produces code and content              |
| **reviewer** | Review deliverable quality, score, approve or reject for rework           | Quality gatekeeper — ensures output meets standards |
| **patrol**   | Monitor system health, flag blocked tasks, send alerts                    | Automated ops — prevents tasks from getting stuck   |

### Agent Workflow

Agents run autonomously through OpenClaw's cron wake-up mechanism. On each wake-up:

1. Call OpenMOSS API to check current state (What tasks do I have? Anything to review?)
2. Execute role-specific actions (Planner assigns tasks, Executor codes, Reviewer reviews…)
3. Write results back to OpenMOSS (submit deliverables, complete reviews, log activity)
4. Go back to sleep, wait for next wake-up

The entire process requires no human intervention. Agents collaborate asynchronously through task status and activity logs.

> **⚙️ Note:** Skills marked with ⚙️ are not plug-and-play. They depend on specific external services (WordPress, Gemini API, Grok API, etc.). Configure the API endpoints and keys for your environment before use. See `SKILL.md` or `references/CONFIG.md` in each Skill directory.

---

## Quick Start

> 📘 **Full deployment:** Follow the [Full Deployment Guide](docs/deployment-guide-en.md) to set up your own AI agent team — including Agent creation, Skill configuration, and OpenClaw integration.
>
> 📸 **Visual tutorial:** Check out the [LINUX DO Visual Deployment Guide](https://linux.do/t/topic/1794669) (with screenshots) for a more intuitive walkthrough.

### Deployment Options

| Method | Prerequisites | Description |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| ⚡ **One-Click Script** | Python 3.10+ | Single command — auto downloads, installs deps, starts the service |
| 🐳 **Docker** | Docker | Containerized deployment, no Python needed |
| 🔧 **Manual** | Python 3.10+ | Full control for developers |

### ⚡ One-Click Script (Recommended)

Just need **Python 3.10+** on your system. One command does everything:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uluckyXH/OpenMOSS/main/setup.sh | bash
```

> The script automatically: downloads latest code → creates Python venv → installs dependencies → starts the service. First install takes ~1 minute (dependency download); subsequent starts are instant.

After successful startup:

```
  ✅ OpenMOSS is running!

  🌐 Access:     http://localhost:6565
  📋 API Docs:   http://localhost:6565/docs
  🛑 Stop:       ./stop.sh
```

- First visit automatically redirects to the **Setup Wizard**
- Data is stored in `openmoss/data/`
- Config file at `openmoss/config.yaml`

**Daily operations:**

```bash
cd openmoss

./start.sh      # Start
./stop.sh       # Stop

# Custom port
OPENMOSS_PORT=8080 ./start.sh
```

**Update to latest version:**

```bash
# Just run the same command again — data and config are preserved
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uluckyXH/OpenMOSS/main/setup.sh | bash
```

> The script auto-detects existing installation → stops running service → updates code (preserves database and config) → restarts.

### 🐳 Docker Deployment

**Option A: Pull pre-built image (fastest, no clone needed)**

```bash
# 1. Download docker-compose.yml
mkdir openmoss && cd openmoss
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uluckyXH/OpenMOSS/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml

# 2. Pull image and start
docker compose up -d
```

**Option B: Build from source**

```bash
# 1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/uluckyXH/OpenMOSS/ openmoss
cd openmoss

# 2. Build and start
docker compose up -d --build
```

After startup:

- Open `http://localhost:6565`
- First visit redirects to the **Setup Wizard**
- Config auto-generated at `./docker-data/config/config.yaml`
- SQLite data persisted in `./data/`

Useful commands:

```bash
docker compose logs -f        # View logs
docker compose down            # Stop
docker compose pull            # Pull latest image
docker compose up -d           # Restart with latest image

# Custom port
OPENMOSS_PORT=8080 docker compose up -d
```

> If external agents need to reach this instance, set `server.external_url` to your public URL in the setup wizard or settings page.

### 🔧 Manual Deployment

For advanced users or developers who want full control:

```bash
# 1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/uluckyXH/OpenMOSS/ openmoss
cd openmoss

# 2. Create virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Start the server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6565
```

### Setup Wizard

Regardless of deployment method, the first visit to `http://localhost:6565` will redirect to the Setup Wizard, guiding you through:

- Setting the **admin password**
- Configuring **project name** and **workspace directory**
- Generating or customizing the **Agent registration token**
- Optionally configuring **notification channels** and **external URL**

After completing the wizard:

| URL                                | Description           |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `http://localhost:6565`            | WebUI Admin Dashboard |
| `http://localhost:6565/docs`       | Swagger API Docs      |
| `http://localhost:6565/api/health` | Health Check          |

### Building the Frontend

> If using the one-click script or Docker, the frontend is already included — no manual build needed.

Only needed for manual deployment when the `static/` directory is missing (requires Node.js 18+):

```bash
cd webui
npm install
npm run build

# Copy build output
rm -rf ../static/*
cp -r dist/* ../static/
cd ..

# Restart backend, frontend auto-loads
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6565
```

---

## Linux Server Deployment

```bash
# 1. Clone project to server
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/uluckyXH/OpenMOSS/ openmoss
cd openmoss

# 2. Create virtual environment and install dependencies
python3 -m venv openmoss-env
source openmoss-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configure (important)
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
vi config.yaml  # or use your preferred editor (nano, vim, etc.)
# Make sure to update:
#   admin.password           — Admin password
#   agent.registration_token — Agent registration token
#   workspace.root           — Working directory path

# 4. Start in background
mkdir -p logs
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 nohup python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6565 --access-log \
  > ./logs/server.log 2>&1 &

# View logs
tail -f logs/server.log

# Stop service
kill $(pgrep -f "uvicorn app.main:app")
```

---

## Roadmap

### Agent Onboarding

- [x] CLI self-update (`update` command auto-downloads latest task-cli.py + SKILL.md)
- [x] Agent Skill API (`/agents/me/skill` serves role-specific SKILL.md with API key pre-filled)
- [x] Quick agent registration (`/agents/register` self-registration + auto-generated onboarding guide with token, Skill download, and API Key setup)
- [ ] Agent onboarding wizard (register and auto-configure, ready out of the box)
- [x] Skill hot-reload (SKILL.md and task-cli.py served via API with live file reads — changes take effect without restart)

### Frontend Improvements

- [x] Dashboard data visualization
- [ ] Task detail page UX improvements
- [ ] Agent management page (create/edit/delete)
- [x] Prompt management page (view/manage role prompts and global rules)
- [ ] Workflow visualization (real-time task flow status)
- [x] Log search and filter page
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### Plugin System

- [ ] Agent achievement system
- [ ] Agent interaction history (collaboration visualization)
- [ ] Agent personas (avatars, signatures, work style tags)

### Infrastructure

- [ ] PostgreSQL / MySQL support
- [ ] One-click Docker deployment
- [ ] CI/CD for frontend builds
- [ ] i18n support
